    <h1>Redirection based on user agent</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> I want to redirect visitors with a specific user agent (<code>*MSIE 8.0*</code> for example) to a different page. It seems this is not possible with Cloudflare Page Rules. Is there any other way to achieve that using Cloudflare?</p>
    <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
    <p>Greetings, Hope this E-mail find you well.</p>
    <p>Yes! you can do accomplish this work, with the help of the Cloudflare workers. It enables to write a code to handle HTTP requests and responses.</p>
