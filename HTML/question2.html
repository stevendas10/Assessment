    <h1>Why is my site coming from California?</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> I’m in London, but looking at your IPs it shows that you are serving my website from California. Can that be right? Why is that? I thought you were supposed to serve my website from some places close to me?</p>
    <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
    <p>Hello, Thank you for your question.</p>
    <p>Inorder to speed up load times, Cloudflare delivers the Content from the closest data center. Nevertheless, there can be a few explanations for why your material seems to be coming from California:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's possible that an Anycast IP address—which might occasionally seem to be from a different location—will route your DNS query.</li>
        <li>The reason for your request being served from a different data center, because the multiple users accessing from same data center may be. In order to server you fast we host from the other nearset DC.</li>
    </ul>
