    <h1>Site down, your name servers are down</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> I am having trouble reaching my website <a href="http://example.com">http://example.com</a> from different networks. Are your nameservers working properly?</p>
    <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
    <p>Greetings of the day, Thank you for getting in touch. I am aware of how annoying it may be when your website is down. Our name servers are up and running, according to my check. Here are several actions to identify the problem:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Please Check your Cloudflare dashboard DNS settings.</li>
        <li>Check the DNS propagation using a tool like <a href="https://www.whatsmydns.net/">WhatsMyDNS</a> to ensure the changes have propagated globally.</li>
        <li>and please make sure that your domain is pointing to Cloudflare's name servers and that it has not expired.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need further assistance, please provide additional details such as error messages or traceroute results from different networks.</p>
