    <title>Question 3: Workers not applied</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Workers not applied</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> I've just added a Worker on the Cloudflare Dashboard for my website: it works in the debugger but doesn't work when I query the site. Why is that? Is there anything to activate or anything I could check?</p>
    <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
    <p>Dear Sir/Madam,Thank you for your inquiry.</p>
    <p>If your worker is operating within the debugger but not while submitting a query to the website, kindly verify the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Make sure the Worker is deployed on your domain to the required route.</li>
        <li>Make sure the route pattern corresponds to the URL structure of your website.</li>
        <li>Verify that the Cloudflare dashboard's Worker script is correctly stored and enabled.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For additional help, kindly provide your Worker script and the route settings if the problem continues.</p>
