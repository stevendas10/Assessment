    <h1>Content not Being Cached</h1>
    <p><strong>Customer:</strong> After activating Cloudflare on my site, I am seeing that resources on my pages are not being cached. <code>curl -svo /dev/null roskolniv.us</code> shows <code>Cache-Control: no-store</code>. Why is Cloudflareâ€™s caching not working on my site?</p>
    <p><strong>Response:</strong></p>
    <p>Thank you for your question.  The Cache-Control: no-store header indicates that caching is disabled for those resources. To make caching active, kindly:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove the Cache-Control: no-store header from your server's response.</li>
        <li>Make sure the appropriate caching headers, are set.</li>
        <li>Make sure caching is turned on for the required resources by checking your Cloudflare Page Rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you need further assistance, please share your caching settings and headers for review.</p>
